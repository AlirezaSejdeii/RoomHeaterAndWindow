# RoomHeaterAndWindow

Question: Imagine you are in a very small room. In this room, there is only a heater and a window to the outside. Currently, it is summer, so you always turn off your heater in the morning and open your windows. However, the situation is different at night. During the night, you will turn on your heater because the weather is cold, and you will also close your windows. The temperature is very important in this scenario. Use your programming skills and OOP principles to virtualize this situation in C# code. Good luck!
 
## some hints:
-	Main goal is to make room temperature average around 29C~33C.
-	When we run program the simple out put should be like this
